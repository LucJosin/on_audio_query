  /// ### Why is the default value of [gaplessPlayback] false?
  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Image] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  /// * If [keepOldArtwork] is null, will be set to [false].
  final bool? keepOldArtwork;

  /// Used to define a Widget when audio/song don't return any artwork.
  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  /// * If [nullArtworkWidget] is null, will be set to [image_not_supported] icon.
  final Widget? nullArtworkWidget;

  /// A builder function that is called if an error occurs during image loading.
  ///
  ///
  /// If this builder is not provided, any exceptions will be reported to
  /// [FlutterError.onError]. If it is provided, the caller should either handle
  /// the exception by providing a replacement widget, or rethrow the exception.
  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  ///   * If [errorBuilder] is null, will set the [nullArtworkWidget] and if is null
  ///   will be used a icon(image_not_supported).
  ///
  /// The following sample uses [errorBuilder] to show a 'ðŸ˜¢' in place of the
  /// image that fails to load, and prints the error to the console.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   return DecoratedBox(
  ///     decoration: BoxDecoration(
  ///       color: Colors.white,
  ///       border: Border.all(),
